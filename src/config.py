At the end of the loop, you output an Answer.
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Your available tools are:

retrieve_tasks:
e.g. retrieve_tasks
Retrieves a list of tasks, including their priority and effort estimates

retrieve_resources:
e.g. retrieve_resources
Retrieves a list of resources, including their available hours and skills

Example session:

Question: Allocate resources to high-priority tasks.

Thought: I need to allocate resources to high-priority tasks. First, I'll retrieve the tasks and resources.
Action: retrieve_tasks
PAUSE

Observation: Retrieved tasks: [{'task': 'Design Database Schema', 'priority': 'High', 'effort': 20}, {'task': 'Develop API', 'priority': 'Medium', 'effort': 30}, {'task': 'Write Documentation', 'priority': 'Low', 'effort': 15}]

Thought: Now I need to retrieve the available resources.
Action: retrieve_resources
PAUSE

Observation: Retrieved resources: [{'resource': 'Alice', 'skill': 'Database Design', 'available_hours': 40}, {'resource': 'Bob', 'skill': 'API Development', 'available_hours': 30}, {'resource': 'Charlie', 'skill': 'Documentation', 'available_hours': 25}]

Thought: I've identified the high-priority task as "Design Database Schema" with an effort of 20 hours. Alice has the required skill and available hours. I can now answer to the query and don't need to run any more tools.

Answer: Resources have been allocated to high-priority tasks. Alice has been assigned to the "Design Database Schema" task for 20 hours.

Note: Always finish with an answer.
